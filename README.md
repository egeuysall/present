# Present: Plan. Track. Gift.

After just one week of focused development, I’m excited to introduce Present. It’s a minimalist gift list app built to help you plan, track, and manage gifts easily across all your devices.

## What I Built

Present includes a secure authentication system that keeps user data safe using privacy-first practices. The interface is clean, fast, and distraction-free so users can focus on the gifts, not the clutter. It also supports real-time syncing, which means your gift lists stay consistent across devices without any manual updates.

## Why It Matters

Gift planning often turns into a mess of scattered notes, forgotten ideas, and missed occasions. Present brings everything together in one place. Whether you’re organizing for birthdays, holidays, or personal milestones, it helps you stay prepared and stress-free.

## Tech Highlights

The backend is powered by technologies like Go and PostgreSQL to ensure speed, security, and stability. The frontend is built using modern frameworks that support fast performance and a responsive layout. Session management is handled with secure cookies using HttpOnly and SameSite flags. All communication between the client and server is handled through REST APIs for simplicity and clarity.

## What’s Next

This is just the first version. Over time, I plan to refine the user experience, add more helpful features, and continue improving the performance and security of the platform. Present will always stay focused on being simple, reliable, and user-friendly.

This project reflects my love for building tools that are both functional and thoughtfully designed. Present is built to be simple, secure, and useful, just the way gift planning should be.
